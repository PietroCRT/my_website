<p>Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following</p>
<pre class="r"><code>url &lt;- &quot;https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx&quot;

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp &lt;- tempfile(fileext = &quot;.xlsx&quot;)))</code></pre>

<pre class="r"><code># Use read_excel to read it as dataframe

<p>We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.</p>

<pre><code>## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;month&#39;. You can override using the `.groups` argument.</code></pre>
<p>Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. Whatâ€™s happening?</p>
<p>However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.</p>
<p><img src="/Users/pietro_crt/Desktop/LBS/Courses/Data Analytics/my_website/images/tfl_monthly.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks 14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).</p>
