```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r load-libraries, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(here)

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)

bike <- bike %>% filter(year>=2016) %>% group_by(year,month) %>% mutate(mean_hired=mean(bikes_hired))
bike1 <- bike %>% filter(year>=2016,year<=2019) %>% group_by(month) %>% mutate(mean_hired_ref=mean(bikes_hired)) 
bike1 <- bike1 %>% summarise(month,mean_hired_ref) %>%  distinct()

bikex <- merge(x = bike, y = bike1, by = "month", all.x = TRUE)
bikex$month <- match(bikex$month,month.abb) 


```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)

bikex$abtest <- ifelse(bikex$mean_hired>bikex$mean_hired_ref, "A", "B") 

bike_final <- bikex %>% summarise(week=week,month=month,year=year,mean_hired=mean_hired,mean_hired_ref=mean_hired_ref,abtest=abtest) %>% distinct()

library(scales)

ggplot(data=bike_final, aes(x=month,y=mean_hired_ref))+
  geom_line(aes(y=mean_hired_ref),color="blue",size=1)+
  geom_line(aes(y=mean_hired),size=0.2)+
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=pmin(mean_hired_ref,mean_hired),ymax=mean_hired),fill="darkseagreen3",alpha=0.5)+
   geom_ribbon(aes(ymax=pmax(mean_hired_ref,mean_hired),ymin=mean_hired),fill="coral2",alpha=0.5)+
  theme_minimal(base_size = 8)+ggtitle("Monthly changes in TfL bike rentals",subtitle = "Change from monthly average shown in blue
and calculated between 2016-2019")+ylab("Bike rentals")+xlab("") +labs(caption = "Source: Tfl, London Data Store")+  scale_x_discrete(limits = month.abb)
  
  

```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks 14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)

bike3 <- bike %>% filter(year>=2016) %>% group_by(year,month,week) %>% mutate(mean_hired=mean(bikes_hired))
bike4 <- bike3 %>% filter(year>=2016,year<=2019) %>% group_by(week) %>% mutate(mean_hired_ref=mean(bikes_hired)) 
bike5 <- bike4 %>% summarise(week,mean_hired_ref) %>%  distinct()
bike5 <- merge(x = bike3, y = bike5, by = "week", all.x = TRUE)
bike5 <- bike5 %>% filter(week!=53) %>% mutate(per_wk_diff=mean_hired/mean_hired_ref-1)

ggplot(data=bike5, aes(x=week,y=per_wk_diff))+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=14,xmax = 26,ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf), fill = 'grey92', alpha = 0.05)+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=40,xmax = 52,ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf), fill = 'grey92', alpha = 0.05)+
  geom_line(size=0.1)+
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  theme_minimal(base_size = 8)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=pmin(per_wk_diff,0),ymax=0),fill="red",alpha=0.5)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax=pmax(0,per_wk_diff)),fill="green",alpha=0.5)+
  geom_rug(sides="b",colour=if_else(bike5$per_wk_diff>0,"green","red"))+
  ggtitle("Weekly changes in TfL bike rentals",subtitle = "% change from weekly averages
calculated between 2016-2019")+
  ylab("")+
  xlab("")+
  labs(caption = "Source: Tfl, London Data Store")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
