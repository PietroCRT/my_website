# Global warming and political views (GSS)

[A 2010 Pew Research poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/2010/10/27/wide-partisan-divide-over-global-warming/) asked 1,306 Americans, "From what you've read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?"


In this exercise we analyze whether there are any differences between the proportion of people who believe the earth is getting warmer and their political ideology. As usual, from the **survey sample data**, we will use the proportions to estimate values of *population parameters*. The file has 2253 observations on the following 2 variables:

- `party_or_ideology`: a factor (categorical) variable with levels Conservative Republican, Liberal Democrat, Mod/Cons Democrat, Mod/Lib Republican
- `response` : whether the respondent believes the earth is warming or not, or Don't know/ refuse to answer

```{r, read_global_warming_pew_data}
global_warming_pew <- read_csv("/Users/pietro_crt/Desktop/LBS/Courses/Data Analytics/ca09.mfa2022/data/global_warming_pew.csv")
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".


```{r}
global_warming_pew %>% 
  count(party_or_ideology, response)

unique(global_warming_pew[c("response")])
```

We will be constructing three 95% confidence intervals to estimate population parameters, for the % who believe that **Earth is warming**, accoridng to their party or ideology. You can create the CIs using the formulas by hand, or use `prop.test()`-- just rememebr to exclude the Dont know / refuse to answer!

Does it appear that whether or not a respondent believes the earth is warming is independent of their party ideology? You may want to

# Biden's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

approval_polllist$Date <- mdy(approval_polllist$enddate) 
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

Also, please add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r}
approval_polllist$week_no <-strftime(approval_polllist$Date-17, format="%V")

approval_polllist2 <- approval_polllist %>% mutate(delta1=(adjusted_approve-adjusted_disapprove)/100)

# We create all the variables that we will need to plot the evolution of the weighted mean approval margin of President Biden with the relative 95% C.I.. Weights are the number of respondents to each survey
library(Hmisc)
approval_polllist3<- approval_polllist2 %>% 
  group_by(week_no) %>%
  group_by(week_no) %>% 
 mutate(weekly_mean_w=wtd.mean(delta1, samplesize),
        weekly_sd_w=sqrt(wtd.var(delta1,samplesize)),
        count_obs=n(),
        t_critical3=qt(0.975,count_obs-1),
        se_delta=weekly_sd_w/sqrt(count_obs),
        error_margin3=t_critical3*se_delta,
        delta_low=weekly_mean_w-error_margin3,
        delta_high=weekly_mean_w+error_margin3) 
approval_polllist3$week_no <- as.numeric(as.character(approval_polllist3$week_no))

#We create all the variables that we will need to plot the evolution of the simple mean approval margin of President Biden with the relative 95% C.I.

approval_polllist4<- approval_polllist2 %>% group_by(week_no) %>% group_by(week_no) %>% 
 mutate(weekly_mean=mean(delta1),
        weekly_sd=sqrt(var(delta1)),
        count_obs=n(),
        t_critical3=qt(0.975,count_obs-1),
        se_delta=weekly_sd/sqrt(count_obs),
        error_margin3=t_critical3*se_delta,
        delta_low=weekly_mean-error_margin3,
        delta_high=weekly_mean+error_margin3)

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 3` and `week 25`. Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.
> The CI shrunk, this means that either the weekly SD decreased or the number of observations increased; both instances result in a lower standard error that in turn gives a tighter CI. In this particular case more suveys could have been conducted in week 25 vs week 3 or opinions were less scattered
